## ðŸ”¬ Procedure: Measuring Thermal Conductivity of Liquids

1. **Launch the Virtual Lab**
   - Open the *Virtual Chemistry Lab* web application.
   - Navigate to the **"Thermal Conductivity of Liquids"** experiment.

2. **Select a Liquid**
   - Choose one of the available liquids (e.g., Water, Ethanol, Glycerol, Mercury, Vegetable Oil) by clicking on its corresponding test tube icon.

3. **Set Experiment Parameters**
   - Input the **distance between plates (d)** in cm.
   - Enter the **plate area (A)** in cmÂ².
   - Set the **initial temperature** of the **hot plate** (Â°C).
   - Set the **initial temperature** of the **cold plate** (Â°C).

4. **Start the Experiment**
   - Click the **"Start Experiment"** button to begin heat transfer simulation.
   - Observe the animation showing heat flow from the hot plate to the cold plate through the selected liquid.

5. **Monitor Temperature Readings**
   - Real-time temperature values for both plates are displayed.
   - A graph dynamically plots the temperature changes over time.
   - The **temperature difference (Î”T)** and **elapsed time** are also shown.

6. **Pause or Reset if Needed**
   - Use the **"Pause"** button to temporarily stop the simulation.
   - Use the **"Reset Experiment"** button to restart with new parameters.

7. **View Data & Results**
   - View tabulated temperature readings in the **Data & Results** section.
   - Observe the temperature graph for a visual representation.
   - The system calculates and displays:
     - **Heat Transfer Rate (Q)** in watts
     - **Thermal Conductivity (k)** in W/mÂ·K

8. **Interpret and Analyze**
   - Review the calculated values and temperature graph.
   - Use Fourierâ€™s Law to understand how thermal conductivity is influenced by material properties and temperature gradients.
