# 🧪 Virtual Lab Experiment: Thermal Conductivity of a Liquid

This virtual experiment simulates the process of determining the **thermal conductivity of a liquid**. In the setup, a known liquid is placed between two metallic plates. The bottom plate is heated, and heat flows through the liquid layer to the top plate. Temperature sensors measure the temperatures at both plates. Once a steady temperature difference is established, thermal conductivity is calculated.

## 🎯 Aim
To determine the **thermal conductivity (k)** of a given liquid using a simulated experimental setup in the virtual lab.

---

## ⚙️ Apparatus (Simulated)
- Two parallel metal plates
- Thin layer of test liquid (e.g., water, oil, glycerin)
- Electric heater (controlled in the simulation)
- Temperature sensors (virtual)
- Stopwatch/timer
- Insulating surroundings

## 🔬 Working Principle
When the heater is turned on, the bottom plate heats up, and heat starts flowing through the liquid to the top plate. After some time, the system reaches a **steady state** — where the temperature difference remains constant. Using the known power input, temperature readings, and liquid thickness, we calculate the liquid’s thermal conductivity.

## 📐 Formula Used
In steady state:
```
k = (P × d) / (A × ΔT)
```
Where:
- `k` = Thermal conductivity (W/m·K)
- `P` = Power supplied to the heater (W)
- `d` = Thickness of the liquid layer (m)
- `A` = Area of the plates (m²)
- `ΔT` = Temperature difference between plates (K or °C)

## 📝 Steps in the Virtual Lab
1. Select the liquid to be tested.
2. Set the thickness of the liquid layer.
3. Start the heater and observe temperature changes.
4. Wait until steady state is reached (temperatures stop changing).
5. Record the power, temperature difference, and area.
6. Use the formula to calculate thermal conductivity.

## ✅ Learning Outcome
- Understand how heat flows through liquids.
- Observe temperature stabilization in steady-state heat transfer.
- Calculate the thermal conductivity of different liquids using real-time simulated data.
